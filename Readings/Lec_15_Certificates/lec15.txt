If the user has not visited the website/domain which the adversary has a browser-acceptable certificate for prior to the MITM attack,
then any validation using client history of key pins will be invalid, since the adversary can simply just modify the certificate that
is sent back as part of the response to the user. However, this attack will not work with DNS key pinning because protocols like DANE
requires that the DNS record containing pinned information must be signed with DNSSEC. As long as the data stored on the DNS server is 
correct in the first place, DNSSEC signing prevents the certificate response from being falsified or replaced by an attack sitting in the
middle of the connection.
