When running a machine as an onion-router Tor node, you are potentially exposing yourself to a DDoS attack, especially if you
don't carefully set the policies on the amount of bandwidth that the Tor service can consume along with placing the proper precautions
of specifying which types of traffic you want to route. In addition, with a global adversary can still be sniffed at the exit node, which 
in some scenarios can put you in legal trouble if it is determined that you are helping route illegal traffic. For some Internet Service Providers 
or servers they might even choose to blacklist IPs which are detected to be routing Tor traffic.

As a client to the Tor network, you may also be potentially exposed to malware and botnet attacks, since malicious exit nodes may be able to
malicious code or information into the packet, which you then unknowingly download

However, the benefits of running an onion-router is that you are helping increase the performance of the Tor network, which yourself can 
take advantage of, along with supporting the robustness, stability, and safety of the network (for not just you but all the other users).
