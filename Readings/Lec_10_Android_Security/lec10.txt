Much of the Android framework is written in Java, which the author argues help protect it against large categories of OS and system exploitation. This is because Java is a statically typed language that offers a lot of memory safety guarantees (unlike C/C++). Thus by using a Java-based VM we can be assured that Android applications are less likely to be able to break out of the virtual machine and that proper memory management will be enforced by the OS.
