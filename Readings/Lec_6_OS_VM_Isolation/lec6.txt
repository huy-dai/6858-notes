I think the most likely attack vectors for AWS Lambda would be more on the frontend architecture (e.g. the the Frontend or Worker Manager) rather than the backend with Firecracker and the MicroVMs, since I feel much more of the security research in this paper is focused on isolating and managing individual containers, and so those would be much harder to escape. For example, the Frontend or Worker Manager may be vulnerable to packet or credential replay, depending on how well they handle currency and data consistency, or finding if there is a way to maker the Worker Manager always yield a new slot for my request, which then can be used as a form of DOS attack.
