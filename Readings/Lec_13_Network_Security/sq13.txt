When it comes to the overall security of the Internet, how do you envision it will be like 20-30 years from 
now? Currently it seems like our strategy has been to retroactively add security measures onto inherently
insecure protocols or use additional layering in the network stack to allow for encryption/ authentication.
However, would it be possible for us to take a much more strict approach and work towards replacing certain
parts of the Internet entirely and deprecating certain old protocols for more secure ones?
