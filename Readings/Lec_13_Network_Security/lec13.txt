While issues relating to TCP sequence number and address-based authentication are no longer an issue 
(as we've since moved on to better form of authentications, including Kerberos and public-private key
authentications), there are still certain issues mention in the paper that still exists today. Those includes:

- Routing: Protocols like BGP are still notorious for being insecure and also susceptible to false route claims. 
We can see this in the global outage for Youtube a few years back due to bad routing info from Pakistant. 
In addition, techniques like ARP poisoning and IP spoofing for Man-in-the-Middle attacks are still viable today.
- DNS: Authentication with DNS are not very widely adopted, and it's still possible to perform
DNS spoofing attacks. In addition, DNS are still susceptible to DOS attacks (see Facebook outage in 2021)
- DOS: ICMP are still most often used for DDos attacks.
- Authentication: While authentication servers have become much more reliable, there are still problems
with proper key management and distribution.
- Protocols with bad security: There are many protocols with bad security that run rampage on the Internet.
HTTP, FTP, and other authentication-less protocols are still being used quite widely.
