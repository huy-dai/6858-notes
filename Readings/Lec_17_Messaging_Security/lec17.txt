In general, email has very similar issues with security that text messaging faces. In theory most email systems are able to guarantee features in trust
establishment (being sure the person you are sending an email to is the intended party) - though this does still fall to attacks like email spoofing - it
is not so great in terms of conversation security and especially transport privacy. Emails headers / metadata readily exposes the sender and recipient, which
means the user privacy is not preserved, and often the encryption keys are maintained by the centralized service hosting the emails rather than being end-to-end 
encryption.

Many of the techniques described for securing messaging systems can also be readily applied to improve email security, such as using better conversation security schemes
and providing greater + more user-friendly support for multiple devices. However, a challenge with emails is that with emails you also need to be able to support the various
email protocols and server designs that exists across different email domains (e.g. @mit.edu might do emails very different from @outlook.com). This will greatly
hinder adoption and require strict backwards compatibility.
