If the 20-byte proxy auth token were to be leaked for one service in OKWS, the attacker can use the token to submit RPC requests to database proxies as that service (assuming it passes through the firewalled LAN). The attacker will then have access to the set of RPC available to that service, which they can use to leak (and potentially write to) user data related to that service, though he/she still doesn't have generic SQL client access. However, theoretically no other services should be affected by this attack, since each web service only knows about its own token.
